        <h2>User Interface and Experience</h2>
        <p>
          The user interface is designed for simplicity and functionality. A
          clean dashboard layout ensures users can navigate seamlessly between
          features. Intuitive icons and easy-to-use forms simplify data input,
          enhancing the overall user experience.

        <h2>Data Stored in the Database</h2>
        <p>
          The database securely stores user profiles, activity logs, nutrition
          data, workout plans, and sleep patterns. This ensures that users have
          a centralized and secure repository for their health information.
          Data-driven insights and recommendations are derived from this
          centralized storage, providing a personalized experience for each
          user.
